I was playing around with [Google Trends](http://www.google.ca/trends/explore#q=%22learn%20to%20code%22%2C%20%22learn%20programming%22&cmpt=q) the other day, and I discovered something interesting for the terms "learn programming" and "learn to code".  
<a href="http://www.google.ca/trends/explore#q=%22learn%20to%20code%22%2C%20%22learn%20programming%22&cmpt=q">
  <img src="{{ root_url }}/images/search_graph.png" width="443" height="207">
</a>

Search volume for both terms has been going up over time since about 2007.
Interest in "programming" was actually *higher* before this, so we're seeing "code" replace it, to some degree.

This makes sense -- "coding" is sexier than "programming"; it's less dusty, more headline-friendly.

What I find most interesting, though, is not why this happens, but *how* it happens -- every time "code" spikes, search volume for "code" goes up, and stays up.

The first spike is from January 2012, when [Codeacademy](http://www.codeacademy.com) started their first "Code Year" push.

The second spike is from March 2013, when [code.org](http://www.code.org) released some 'Learn to Code' videos featuring all sorts of top tech names -- and Chris Bosh. *Of course.*

### Context

I've been thinking about this for a while, but my inspiration for writing it up was [code != computer science](http://www.ultrasaurus.com/2013/12/code-computer-science/) by Sarah Allen.
She said most of this better than I will, so I urge you to read it.



## Should you learn to code?

I think the answer here is unequivocally yes, if you have the free time and desire to do so.
We all rely on technology and software to an incredible degree.
The type of logical thinking required to design, implement, and troubleshoot programs and algorithms can be applied to many other tasks.

### What sort of resources are available?

####Free / inexpensive
These include videos, classes (formal and informal), and ebooks, as well as websites and blogs.
One great aggregator of free content is [Bento](http://www.bentobox.io/) -- they have links to popular tutorials for almost anything!

I'm working on a free class myself -- keep an eye on this blog for more info.

####Subscription
One example here is [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com). They offer a $25 and a $49 plan, with varying features -- both include extensive amounts of videos.

####"Bootcamps"
These are expensive (anywhere from $4k to $12k or more), and very intense. They typically run for 8-12 weeks, and are basically a full-time job in terms of workload.

### Check your privilege!

Look: I have a computer engineering degree, and I've been working professionally on software since 2004.
It's no surprise that I think my degree was worth the money and time, if only because of the time period dedicated to learning.

But even I agree that a CS degree is by no means a requirement to be a successful software developer -- especially in 2013, with all the resources that are now available.

### Be realistic

That said, I can't help but feel that maybe some people are putting too much faith in how 'Learn to Code' will change their lives.
It feels a little predatory:

"You can earn up to $100k as a Coder!"

Well, okay, yes, it's *possible*, but it takes serious work to develop those sorts of skills and knowledge.
No matter how hard you work, you can't become an expert overnight, or even in three months.
And if you need to hold down your existing job to take care of your family, your options are even more limited.

### Stay humble

Make sure, as you're learning about programming, that you try to keep track of the things you *don't* know.
Most people love working with someone who is aware of their limitations and truly wants to learn.

### Have a goal

It doesn't really work to learn to code simply so you *can*.
You need something to work towards, something you'd like to accomplish, something you'd like to build.

It helps to start small -- maybe you just want a simple webpage with your toddler's 10 current favorite YouTube videos.




## Advice

The takeaway here depends on who you are and what you want to get out of 'learning to code':

####Students
* If you're still in school, I'd urge you to learn more about computers and coding, even if you have to do it on your own.
* If you're working toward a computer degree, make sure you supplement it with other coding experience -- whether it's part-time employment, open source, or simply hacking on your own projects.

####Non-tech people who work with techies
* Learning to code will help you at work. Ask someone for a list of technologies you use and try to learn more about those, or about related topics.
* Be realistic about what you know -- never assume that you can estimate how long a task will take without knowing the details!  

####Junior developers
* A rising tide lifts all boats -- if you let it. Make sure you take advantage of all the resources you have available. The guy who wants your job certainly will.

####Senior developers
* Make sure you promote best principles and practices to the junior developers on your team.
* Work on your teaching / presenting skills -- you may soon find you're the only one on your team with a CS degree, and your team will benefit from your knowledge.
* Make sure you don't slack on your continuing education either -- technology evolves quickly, and you have to stay ahead.

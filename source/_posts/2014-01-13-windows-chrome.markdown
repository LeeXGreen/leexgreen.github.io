Anyone who knows me will tell you that I don't exactly have great fashion sense.
I don't wear bespoke suits. My house is not "exquisitely decorated", or "tastefully appointed".

That said, when I created this blog, I knew it would take a few tweaks to set it apart
from the thousands of other Octopress blogs out there, so I started looking for fonts.

I quickly found Montserrat and Varela Round.

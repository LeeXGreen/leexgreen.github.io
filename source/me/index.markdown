I'm an American (15 years in Texas), currently living in Montreal, Canada.<br>
I work as a Senior Software Developer at [TouchTunes](http://www.touchtunes.com/).

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/LeeXGreen) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leexgreen) if you're so inclined.

Cool things I've done (that I can talk about):

* [SXSW 2013](http://www.touchtunes.com/sxsw/)
  * I designed and built the system that allowed party attendees to control the night's playlist. This was a lot of fun, and I definitely appreciated the chance to see Austin again.
